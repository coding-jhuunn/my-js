# Time and Space Complexity

Time complexity - is the duration to run the algorithm

Space complexity - is the capacity of required memory to run the algorithm

linear complexity - it is a perfect one to one relationship to the number of inputs and to number of time it takes to execute the algorithm

logarithmic -

quadratic - loop within in loop
